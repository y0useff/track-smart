Track Smart was built upon the concept of preventing unforeseen accidents, through the implementation of a model to observe, track, and identify objects such as cars, trucks, trains, humans, etc in the vicinity of key junction points like railroad crossing and stations. Early detection serves to alert central transit hubs, where operators can then foresee possible hazards on the track. Thus, Track Smart aims to eliminate possible accidents through forewarning.
